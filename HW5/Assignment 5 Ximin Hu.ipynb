    "A medical testing company has developed a two-stage, non-invasive test for Down’s syndrome in the first two months of pregnancy. Initial tests have shown that when the fetus actually has Down’s syndrome, the test correctly identifies this by giving a positive result 98% of the time (i.e. the observed probability of a false negative is 2%). Furthermore, in cases when the fetus does not have Down’s syndrome, the test result is negative 97% of the time (i.e. the observed probability of a false positive is 3%). Armed with this data, the company’s statisticians are charged with estimating the overall probability that a given fetus has Down’s syndrome if the test shows positive. Assume the observed probability of Down’s syndrome in a random sample from a large number of observations is about 1 in 1,200 (this is the reported value for a 25-year-old mother; the risk is higher for older mothers)."

    "Using Bayes’ theorem, estimate the overall probability that a given fetus has Down’s syndrome if the test shows positive. Are you surprised by the answer? What is the fundamental problem with this test? How accurate would the test have to be to achieve a 50% probability of having the disease if the test showed a positive result? (For the last one, experiment with the accuracies of both the positive and negative test results.)"
