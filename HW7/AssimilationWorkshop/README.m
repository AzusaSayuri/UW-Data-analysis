%  EnKFCourse: assimilates observations of SWE from the snow course, and
%               compares to the snow pillow. Observations are pulled using
%               ExtractObservationsCourse

%  EnKFDepth: assimilates observations of acoustic depth measurements using
%               an assumption of constant density

%  EnKFDepthDV: assimilates observations of acoustic depth measurements using
%               variable density as predicted by Sturm et al. 2010
